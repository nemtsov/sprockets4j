Sprockets4j [Project Status](http://stillmaintained.com/georgecalm/sprockets4j.png)
===========

**Note: I've stopped developing this project, as I no longer believe in it's usefulness. Consider using [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) instead.**



----

Sprockets4j is a Java port of [Sam Stephenson's Sprockets Ruby library](http://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets). 

## Why port?

To learn Ruby. I strongly believe that the best way to learn anything is to need the knowledge. Porting requires good understanding of the code, and thus creates that need, essential for learning the language.
